=============

For non Docker upgrade have a look on the nondocker_CHANGELOG

1. The structure of the project change:
   * The package name become `demo_geoportal`.
   * The package is in the folder `geoportal`.

2. In the file `project.yaml.mako` the checker path should we set to `/c2c/health_check?`.

3. In the file `Makefile` replace `vars_demo.yaml` by `vars.yaml`.

4. The `checker` section of the file `vars.yaml` should be rewritten like it's in `CONST_create_template/vars.yaml`.

5. The `shortener.email_body` in the vars files use now the template syntax.

6. Add at the end of the `vars.yaml` file add the following lines:

   + no_interpreted:
   +   - shortener.email_body
   +   - reset_password.email_body

7. For the docker version: In all your `mapserver/*.map.mako` files you should add at the top:

   + <%!
   + from c2cgeoportal_geoportal.lib import confd_env
   + %>

   and replace `${host}${entry_point}` by `${host | confd_env}${entry_point | confd_env}`
   and `${mapserver_connection}` by `${mapserver_connection | confd_env}`

8. Rename your l10n files with e.-g.:

   mv geoportal/demo_geoportal/locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES/demo{,_geoportal}-client.po

9. Update access control list (ACL) in root context to allow user with role 'role_admin' to acess views requiring 'admin' permission.

   edit 'geoportal/demo_geoportal/resources.py' file, Root class __acl__ attribute should look so:

   '''...
   from pyramid.security import Allow, ALL_PERMISSIONS
   ...

   class Root:
       __acl__ = [
           (Allow, 'role_admin', ALL_PERMISSIONS),
       ]
   ...'''
